With Yarn 2, you could easily install Husky by setting your package to private and defining a `postinstall` script:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "husky install"
  },
  "packageManager": "yarn@2.4.3"
}
```

However, Yarn 3 doesn't seem to work with `postinstall`. This means that you can't use Husky with Yarn 3 without some extra work.

## First iteration: plugin-install-husky

Wanna know what awesome feature Yarn 3 has? A plugin system! This means that you can write your own plugins to extend Yarn's functionality.

At [Truffle](https://truffle.vip?utm-source=blog.fyko.net), we've been using this short script to install Husky.

```js
// Creative Commons (c) 2022 Spore, Inc. 
const { exec } = require('child_process');

const plugin = {
  default: {
    hooks: {
      afterAllInstalled: async () =>
        exec('git config core.hooksPath .github/hooks'),
    },
  },
};

module.exports = {
  name: 'plugin-install-husky',
  factory: () => plugin,
};
```
But, frankly, since we have plugins, we don't really <T>need</T> to use Husky. Introducing...

## âœ¨ plugin-git-hooks âœ¨

Lets eject Husky! Start by running `yarn remove husky` and delete the `postinstall` script from `package.json`.

Now, you can move your scripts from `.husky` to anywhere else. I recommend `.github/hooks`.

Then, import the plugin.
```console
$ yarn plugin import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflehq/yarn-plugin-git-hooks/main/bundles/%40yarnpkg/plugin-git-hooks.js
```

Finally, add the path to your hooks in `.yarnrc.yml`:
```yaml
gitHooksPath: .github/hooks
```

Now, whenever you run `yarn` (once packages are installed), your hooks will be configured.

Shout my boss for letting me [open-source this plugin](https://github.com/trufflehq/yarn-plugin-git-hooks)!
